@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
do a simple conversation in 8 bits right alignment of 0xFF value, the result of 
conversion can be seen by connecting PA4(DAC channel1) to an oscilloscope.

STM32 Nucleo board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED2 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on  STM32L052xx, STM32L053xx STM32L062xx and 
    STM32L063xx device lines RevZ.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L053R8-Nucleo RevC  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L053R8-Nucleo Set-up
    - Use LED2 connected to PA5 pin.
    - Connect PA4 (pin 32 in CN7 connector)(DAC Channel1) pin to an oscilloscope.
  

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
