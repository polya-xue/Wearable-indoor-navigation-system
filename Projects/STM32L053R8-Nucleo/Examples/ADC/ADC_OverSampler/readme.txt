@par Example Description 

This example describes how to configure and use ADC to convert an external
analog input (PA0) combined with oversampling feature to increase resolution,
through the STM32L0xx HAL API.
  
The ADC is configured to convert continuously channel0, the oversampler is
enabled in order to increase resolution. Oversampling ratio is set to 128x so
the maximum output result is 0x7FF80 (19 bit), since the ADC_DR is a 16 bit
register, 3 right bit shift is performed to keep only the 16 last significant
bits by setting the RightBitShift to 3.

uwConvertedValue variable handles the 16 bit conversion result and uwInputVoltage
handles the input voltage. 

  
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L051xx, STM32L052xx, STM32L053xx STM32L062xx and 
    STM32L063xx device lines RevZ
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L053R8-Nucleo RevC  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Connect an external signal to PA.0 (A0 Arduino connector).
  - To monitor the conversion results, put uwConvertedValue and uwInputVoltage
    in the live watch.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
