@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to configure the AES hardware 
accelerator to encrypt then to decrypt text with the different modes ECB, CBC 
et CTR.

Select the AES modes to be performed by uncommenting the corresponding line inside 
the main.h file.

// #define AES_ECB
// #define AES_CBC
// #define AES_CTR

This example is a basic example using polling on flag, neither interrupt nor 
DMA capability are used.

After encryption, the user presses to Key button to execute the decryption on each mode. 

LED2 is togged to notify if the Encryption/Decryption failed.
LED2 is turned on to notify if the Encryption/Decryption passed.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L06x devices RevZ
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L053R8-Nucleo RevC  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM32L053R8-Nucleo Set-up
    - Use LED2 connected to PA.05 pin
    - Use KEY push button connected to PC.13 pin
          
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
