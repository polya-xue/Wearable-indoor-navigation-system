BlueNRG is sometimes undiscoverable after premature disconnection
------------------------------------------------------------------
Applications in folder Projects\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\Applications\Bluetooth_LE:
    - HRM_LowPowerRTC
	- SensorDemo
	- SensorDemo_GATTServer
    
If you press the disconnect button on the smartphone app while a connection is being setup with the BlueNRG (acting as Peripheral), sometimes the device becomes undiscoverable (no advertising sent). This can be reproduced by pressing connect and then disconnect in a very short time and continuously repeating this procedure very quickly.
When this happens, you need to hard-reset the NucleoL0 board by unplugging the Nucleo board from the power and then restart the smartphone application.

This bug will be fixed with release 6.4 of the firmware for the BlueNRG expansion board (shield).

In the meantime, this problem can be avoided by simply waiting for the connection to be fully established before hitting the disconnect button on the phone.

Otherwise, if this issue is critical in your setup and you need to fix it now (without waiting for version 6.4 of the Firmware), then you can flash the firmware 'ifr_3v0_006_mode02-16MHz-RO.dat' on the BlueNRG expansion board by following the procedure described in file:
Projects\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\Applications\Bluetooth_LE\Readme.txt
If you use the 'ifr_3v0_006_mode02-16MHz-RO.dat' firmware, however, the power consumption of the BlueNRG expansion board will increase. The fix that will be released with version 6.4, instead, will not affect consumption. Therefore we recommend that you wait for version 6.4.
